Introduction to FOSS Compliance

# --------------------

** FOSS Compliance Goals

- Know your obligations. You should have a process for identifying and tracking
  FOSS components that are present in your software

- Satisfy license obligations. Your process should be capable of handling FOSS
  license obligations that arise from your organization’s business practices

# --------------------

** What Compliance Obligations Must Be Satisfied?

Depending on the FOSS license(s) involved, your compliance obligations may consist of:

- Attribution and Notices. You may need to provide or retain copyright and license text in the
  source code and/or product documentation or user interface, so that downstream users know
  the origin of the software and their rights under the licenses. You may also need to provide
  notices regarding modifications, or full copies of the license.

- Source code availability. You may need to provide source code for the FOSS software, for
  modifications you make, for combined or linked software, and scripts that control the build
  process.

- Reciprocity. You may need to maintain modified versions or derivative works under the same
  license that governs the FOSS component.

- Other terms. The FOSS license may restrict use of the copyright holder name or trademark,
  may require modified versions to use a different name to avoid confusion, or may terminate
  upon any breach.

# --------------------

** FOSS Compliance Issues: Distribution

- Dissemination of material to an outside entity 
  - Applications downloaded to a user’s machine or mobile device
  - JavaScript, web client, or other code that is downloaded to the user’s machine 

- For some FOSS licenses, access via a computer network can be
  a “trigger” event
  - Some licenses define the trigger event to include permitting access to software running
    on a server (e.g., all versions of the Affero GPL if the software is modified) or in the
    case of “users interacting with it remotely through a computer network”

# --------------------

** FOSS Compliance Issues: Modification

- Changes to the existing program (e.g., additions, deletions of code in a file,
  combining components together)

- Under some FOSS licenses, modifications may cause additional obligations
  upon distribution, such as:
  - Providing notice of modification 
  - Providing accompanying source code 
  - Licensing modifications under the same license that governs the FOSS component

# --------------------

** FOSS Compliance Program

Organizations that have been successful at FOSS compliance have created
their own FOSS Compliance Programs (consisting of policies, processes,
training and tools) to:

1. Facilitate effective usage of FOSS in their products (commercial or
   otherwise)

2. Respect FOSS developer/owner rights and comply with license obligations

3. Contribute to and participate in FOSS communities

# --------------------

** Implementing Compliance Practices

Prepare business processes and sufficient staff to handle:

- Identification of the origin and license of all internal and external software

- Tracking FOSS software within the development process

- Performing FOSS review and identifying license obligations

- Fulfillment of license obligations when product ships 

- Oversight for FOSS Compliance Program, creation of policy, and compliance
  decisions

- Training

# --------------------

** Compliance Benefits

Benefits of a robust FOSS Compliance program include:

- Increased understanding of the benefits of FOSS and how it impacts your organization

- Increased understanding of the costs and risks associated with using FOSS 

- Increased knowledge of available FOSS solutions

- Reduction and management of infringement risk, increased respect of FOSS
  developers/owners’ licensing choices

- Fostering relationships with the FOSS community and FOSS organizations
