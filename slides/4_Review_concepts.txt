** CHAPTER 4

Key Software Concepts
for FOSS Review

# --------------------

** How do you want to use a FOSS component?

Common scenarios include:

- Incorporation

- Linking

- Modification

- Translation

# --------------------

** Incorporation

A developer may copy portions of a FOSS component into your software product. 

Relevant terms include:
- Integrating
- Merging
- Pasting
- Adapting
- Inserting

# --------------------

** Linking

A developer may link or join a FOSS component with your software product. 

Relevant terms include:
- Static/Dynamic Linking
- Pairing
- Combining
- Utilizing
- Packaging
- Creating interdependency

# --------------------

** Modification

A developer may make changes to a FOSS component, including:

- Adding/injecting new code into the FOSS component
- Fixing, optimizing or making changes to the FOSS component
- Deleting or removing code

# --------------------

** Translation

A developer may transform the code from one state to another.

Examples include:
- Translating Chinese to English 
- Converting C++ to JavaÂ 
- Compiling into binary

# --------------------

** Development Tools

Development tools may perform some of these operations behind the scenes.

For example, a tool may inject portions of its own code into output of the tool.

# --------------------

** How is the FOSS component distributed?

- Who receives the software?
  - Customer/Partner
  - Community project
  - Another legal entity within the business group (this may count as
    distribution)


- What format for delivery?
  - Source code delivery
  - Binary delivery
  - Pre-loaded onto hardware

# --------------------
