Developer Guidelines

# --------------------

** Developer Guidelines

- Select code from high quality, well supported FOSS communities

- Seek guidance
  - Request formal approval for each FOSS component you are using 
  - Do not check un-reviewed code into any internal source tree
  - Request formal approval for outside contributions to FOSS projects

- Preserve existing licensing information
  - Do not remove or in any way disturb existing FOSS licensing copyrights or other licensing
    information from any FOSS components that you use. All copyright and licensing
    information is to remain intact in all FOSS components
  - Do not re-name FOSS components unless you are required to under the FOSS license (e.g.,
    required renaming of modified versions)

- Gather and retain FOSS project information required for your FOSS review
  process

# --------------------

** Anticipate Compliance Process Requirements

- Include time required to follow established FOSS policy in work plans
  - Follow the developer guidelines for using FOSS software, particularly incorporating or linking FOSS
    code into proprietary or third party source code or vice versa 
  - Review architecture plans and avoid mixing components governed by incompatible FOSS licenses

- Always update compliance verification - for every product
  - Verify compliance on a product-by-product basis: Just because a FOSS package is approved for
    use in one product does not necessarily mean it will be approved for use in a second product

- And for every upgrade to newer versions of FOSS 
  - Ensure that each new version of the same FOSS component is reviewed and approved 
  - When you upgrade the version of a FOSS package, make sure that the license of the new version is
    the same as the license of the older used version (license changes can occur between version
    upgrades)
  - If a FOSS project’s license changes, ensure that compliance records are updated and that the new
    license does not create a conflict

# --------------------

** Compliance Process Applies to all FOSS components

- In-bound software
  - Take steps to understand what FOSS is included in software delivered by suppliers 
  - Evaluate your obligations for all of the software that will be included in your products
  - Always audit source code you received from your software providers or alternatively make it
    a company policy that software providers must deliver you a source code audit report for
    any source code you receive

# --------------------

** Check Your Understanding

- Name some general guidelines developers can practice when working with FOSS.

- Should you remove or alter FOSS license header information?

- Name some important steps in a compliance process.

- How can a new version of a previously-reviewed FOSS component create new
  compliance issues?

- What risks should you address with in-bound software?
