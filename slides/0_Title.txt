** What is the OpenChain Curriculum?

- The OpenChain Project helps to identify and share the core components
  of a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) compliance program.

- The core of the OpenChain Project is the Specification. This identifies and
  publishes the core requirements a FOSS compliance program should satisfy.

- The OpenChain Curriculum supports the Specification by providing
  freely available training material.

- These slides help companies satisfy the requirements of the Specification
  Section 1.2. They can also be used for general compliance training.
