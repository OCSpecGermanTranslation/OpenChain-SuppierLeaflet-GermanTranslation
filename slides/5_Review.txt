** CHAPTER 5

Running a FOSS Review

# --------------------

** FOSS Review

- After Program and Product Management and Engineers have
  reviewed proposed FOSS components for usefulness and quality, a review
  of the rights and obligations
  associated with the use of the selected components should be initiated

- A key element to a FOSS Compliance Program is a FOSS Review process. This
  process is where a company can analyze the FOSS software it uses and
  understand its rights and obligations 

- The FOSS Review process includes the following steps:
  - Gather relevant information
  - Analyze and understand license obligations
  - Provide guidance compatible with company policy and business objectives

# --------------------

** Initiating a FOSS Review

Anyone working with FOSS in the company should be able to initiate a FOSS
Review, including Program or Product Managers, Engineers, and Legal. 

Note: The process often starts when new FOSS-based software is selected by
engineering or outside vendors.

# --------------------

** What information do you need to gather?

- When analyzing FOSS usage, collect information about the identity of the FOSS
  component, its origin, and how the FOSS component will be used. This may
  include:
  - Package name
  - Status of the community around the package (activity, diverse membership,
    responsiveness)
  - Version
  - Download or source code URL
  - Copyright owner
  - License and License URL
  - Attribution and other notices and URLs
  - Description of modifications intended to be made
  - List of dependencies
  - Intended use in your product
  - First product release that will include the package
  - Location where the source code will be maintained
  - Possible previous approvals in another context
  - If from an external vendor: 
  - Development team's point of contact
  - Copyright notices, attribution, source code for vendor modifications if
    needed to satisfy license obligations

# --------------------

** FOSS Review Team

A FOSS Review team includes the company representatives that support, guide, coordinate and
review the use of FOSS. These representatives may include:

- Legal to identify and evaluate license obligations

- Source code scanning and tooling support to help identify and track FOSS usage

- Engineering Specialists working with business interests, commercial licensing, export
  compliance, etc., who may be impacted by FOSS usage

# --------------------

** Analyzing Proposed FOSS Usage

The FOSS Review team should assess the information it has gathered before providing guidance
for issues. This may include scanning the code to confirm the accuracy of the information.

The FOSS Review team should consider:
- Is the code and associated information complete, consistent and accurate?
- Does the declared license match what is in the code files?
- Does the license permit use with other components of the software? 

# --------------------

Source Code Scanning Tools

- There are many different automated source code scanning tools. 

- All of the solutions address specific needs and - for that reason - none
  will solve all possible challenges

- Companies pick the solution most suited to their specific market area and
  product

- Many companies use both an automated tool and manual review

- A good example of freely available source code scanning tool is FOSSology,
  a project hosted by the Linux Foundation:

# --------------------

** Working through the FOSS Review

The FOSS Review process crosses disciplines, including engineering, business, and legal teams. It
should be interactive to ensure all those groups correctly understand the issues and can create
clear, shared guidance.

# --------------------

FOSS Review Oversight

The FOSS Review process should have executive oversight to resolve disagreements and approve
the most important decisions.

** Check Your Understanding

- What is the purpose of a FOSS Review?

- What is the first action you should take if you want to use FOSS components?

- What should you do if you have a question about using FOSS?

- What kinds of information might you collect for a FOSS review?

- What information helps identify who is licensing the software? 

- What additional information is important when reviewing a FOSS component
  from an outside vendor?

- What steps can be taken to assess the quality of information collected in a
  FOSS Review?
