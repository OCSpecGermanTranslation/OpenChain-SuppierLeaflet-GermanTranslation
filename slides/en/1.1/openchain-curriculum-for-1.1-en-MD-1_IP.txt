** CHAPTER 1

What is Intellectual Property?

# --------------------

** What is “Intellectual Property”?

- Copyright: protects original works of authorship 
  - Protects expression (not the underlying idea) 
  - It covers software, books, and similar works

- Patents: useful inventions that are novel and non-obvious 
  - Limited monopoly to incentivize innovation

- Trade secrets: protects valuable confidential information

- Trademarks: protects marks (word, logos, slogans, color, etc.) that identify
  the source of the product	
  - Consumer and brand protection; avoid consumer confusion and brand dilution

This chapter will focus on copyright and patents,
the areas most relevant to FOSS compliance.

# --------------------

** Copyright Concepts in Software

- Basic rule: copyright protects creative works

- Copyright generally applies to literary works, such as books, movies,
  pictures, music, maps

- Software is protected by copyright
  - Not the functionality (that’s protected by patents) but the expression (creativity in
    implementation details)
  - Includes Binary Code and Source Code 

- The copyright owner only has control over the work that he or she created,
  not someone else’s independent creation

- Infringement may occur if copying without the permission of the author

# --------------------

** Copyright Rights Most Relevant to Software

- The right to reproduce the software – making copies

- The right to create “derivative works” – making modifications
  - The term derivative work comes from the US Copyright Act 
  - It is a “term of art” meaning that it has a particular meaning based on the statute and not
    the dictionary definition
  - In general it refers to a new work based upon an original work to which enough original
    creative work has been added so that the new work represents an original work of
    authorship rather than a copy

- The right to distribute
  - Distribution is generally viewed as the provision of a copy of a piece of software,
    in binary or source code form, to another entity (an individual or organization outside
    your company or organization)

Note: The interpretation of what constitutes a “derivative work” or a “distribution”
is subject to debate in the FOSS community and within FOSS legal circles

# --------------------

** Patent Concepts in Software

- Patents protect functionality – this can include a method of operation,
  such as a computer program
  - Does not protect abstract ideas, laws of nature

- A patent application must be made in a specific jurisdiction in order to obtain
  a patent in that country. If a patent is awarded, the owner has the right to stop
  anybody from exercising its functionality, regardless of independent creation 

- Other parties who want to use the technology may seek a patent license
  (which may grant rights to use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, and
  import the technology)

- Infringement may occur even if other parties independently create the same
  invention

# --------------------

** Licenses

- A “license” is the way a copyright or patent holder gives permission or
  rights to someone else

- The license can be limited to:
  - Types of use allowed (commercial / non-commercial, distribution, derivative works / to
    make, have made, manufacture)
  - Exclusive or non-exclusive terms
  - Geographical scope
  - Perpetual or time limited duration

- The license can have conditions on the grants, meaning you only get
  the license if you comply with certain obligations
  - E.g, provide attribution, or give a reciprocal license

- May also include contractual terms regarding warranties, indemnification,
  support, upgrade, maintenance

** Check Your Understanding

- What type of material does copyright law protect?

- What copyright rights are most important for software?

- Can software be subject to a patent? 

- What rights does a patent give to the patent owner?

- If you independently develop your own software, is it possible that
  you might need a copyright license from a third party for that software?
  A patent license?
