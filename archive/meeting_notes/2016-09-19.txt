The slides are divided into 8 chapters with a "Check Your Understanding" at the end of each chapter

The slides will be formally launched at LinuxCon Europe in October on the 5th and we will have a 90 minute deep dive on the content -Answers to "Check Your Understanding" will be expanded in a later "handbook" for trainers with a projected release date around December, with work on that starting during our October deep-dive in LinuxCon Europe -Discussion just opened with the Linux Foundation about hosting the "Check Your Understanding" questions and answers as a free online test in the future

Action item: 

There is now a general request for everyone to check the slides to ensure correct terminology or further simplification of language, with a deadline of 30th September for all changes, which may take the form of direct edits or just adding comments to the slides.
