Launch of the OpenChain Release 2 reference slide deck.

This deck has the following improvements: 
1. There are slide notes for trainers throughout the material to make delivery easier.
2. There are answers to the "Check Your Understanding" questions at the end of each chapter to assist with the creation of internal exams.
3. The content of some slides has been adjusted to make things clearer and simpler.
