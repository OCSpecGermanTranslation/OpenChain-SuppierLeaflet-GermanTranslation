2016/8/15 meeting 

Due to work commitments and vacation the first draft has been pushed out to September. Still on target to release draft in October. 

Call for everyone to assist with refining the existing 177 slides into ~100 slides with a few bullet point "check your understanding" questions to end each chapter

Will create a new template once chapters are complete for a coherent look
