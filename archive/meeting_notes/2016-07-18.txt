2016/7/18 meeting, current plan is to: 

Each chapter is substantially complete. We currently have around 194 slides that need to be refined into about 100 slides for circa 3 hour delivery. 

We will "be brave" in condensing material to make it as simple as possible, so everyone should feel free to jump in and condense and/or simplify language.

Where content is deleted from slides we will move it into slide notes to ensure presenters can have context. This is because we cannot assume a level of knowledge for the reader/presenter. We need to facilitate everything from low to high.

We need to add "check your understanding" to most chapters (see reference material from Chapter 7). This will ensure each module can work as a stand-alone mini-segment. For the same reason it would be ideal if each chapter could start with a high-level summary.

The status of each chapter is based on reports from assigned Chapter authors (see above for current status). However, everyone is invited to open and edit the slides to help ensure we have a completed deliverable for the next call. The slides can be found here: https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=674AE6F2A656C9C5!799&ithint=file%2cpptx&app=PowerPoint&authkey=!AMPIqg6TBlScFUI 

Each chapter should end up being somewhere between 8 and 10 slides including the "Check Your Understanding" slide. Please feel free to edit the content of any chapter and hide any slide you think is unnecessary. We can also add blank placeholder slides for individual company processes, to both show that we expect companies to customise, and to help underline that our curriculum material alone is not enough for a solid process.
