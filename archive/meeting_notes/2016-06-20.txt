2016/6/20 meeting, current plan is to: 

refine existing 175 slides into 100 slides for circa 3 hour delivery.

The slides are currently split into 12 "chapters" and we will add a one slide "check your understanding" mini-test to end each chapter

We will assign one "chapter" to each explicit OpenChain Curriculum volunteer for this editing process. Coincidentally we have twelve volunteers:
- Dave Marr
- Jilayne Lovejoy
- Kate Stewart
- Ramesh Jain
- Shane Coughlan
- Tom Arcidiacono
- Gary O'Neall
- Hung Chang
- Catharina Maracke
- Arnold Niessen
- Mark Radcliffe
- Nathan Kumagai

The process will be to adjust/hide slides inside each chapter as needed to refine the material, and then to add a one slide "check your understanding" quiz.

The combination of the 12 "check your understanding" mini-test slides will make up our first OpenChain test material

We will create a simple mapping of Curriculum slides to the Specification

We will add master slide text that this Curriculum material alone is not enough for compliance

We will add placeholder slides for individual company processes

We will create a direct link to each chapter to make editing easier
