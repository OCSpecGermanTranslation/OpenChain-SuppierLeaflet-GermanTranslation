2016/10/05 LinuxCon Europe meeting, Berlin 

What is next for the OpenChain Curriculum? 

At LinuxCon Europe we sat down and had a detailed discussion about what we are doing, where we are going, and what deliverables are needed. 

Executive summary: 

- We need to create a FAQ for the curriculum
- We need to create a "training handbook" for the slides
- We need to integrate some comments and minor adjustments on the release slides
- Our target for these improvements is a December 2016 release
- Larger changes like expanding the slides will occur in 2017
- We will open a mailing list for the Curriculum team to ensure we do not create too much traffic on this main list.
- Our first translation is underway! Haksung Jang at LG Electronics has volunteered to translate our Release 1 slides to Korean.

FAQ

We need to explain some items in a FAQ: 
Q: What is this slide deck used for? A: This is a reference deck to meet OpenChain specification 1.0, requirement 1.2 
Q: what is the audience? A: businesses who are shipping open source and audience software staff as defined in spec 
Q: Length of training session A: meant to be given in half day 
Q: What jurisdiction does the IP law section cover? A: US law for now 
Q: Are these slides everything you need to be compliant with licenses? A: No, this is a reference deck 
Q: How to contribute? (put both in FAQ and slide deck) 
Q: What is scanning technology 

Training Handbook

We decided to change the handbook for teachers into a simpler solution: 
- we will create expanded notes under each slide for trainers and 
- we will provide slide note reference answers to each of the "Check Your Understanding" questions.
This will also make it easier for Gary to eventually make an online quiz to support people directly using the reference deck. 

Slide Adjustments
- We need to resolve the existing comments in the Slide notes as our first action item.
- We need to create a placeholder for localization for different jurisdictions. Our discussion was to leverage the IFOSS Law Book as one example of reference material.
- We need to normalize the slide to US law and state this in slides. Jilayne has taken this as an action item. Thanks Jilayne!
- We need to make one adjustment to Chapter 6: prior to the explanation of a large enterprise process we will add a slide to say "small businesses may just use a checklist, larger enterprises will have a detailed process. Here is an example of an enterprise process."

Stuff pushed back to 2017: 
- Larger changes to Chapter 6 to make it more accessible.
- Chapter 8 review and release.
- We need to looking at other material to use / make OpenChain compliant. We agreed to start with existing Linux Foundation material available here:
